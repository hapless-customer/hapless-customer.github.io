title: "Hazards and Uses of Self-Reported Data"
---

[Here's][self-reported] a fantastic list of surveys where self-reported data are hilariously or embarrasingly wrong. What do these failures have in common, and is there an equally long list of studies where self-reported data was accurate and useful?

All of these topics are mood affiliated with some sort of shameful behavior - what we should naively expect to lead to false reporting. The one positive self-reported data use in the list (self-reporting of race) is demographic. Between demographic (identity) and shameful (a subset of behavioral) data, there are likely uses which are worth not ignoring.



Finally, is there a way to increase accuracy of self-reported data around behavior or history? If respondents were informed that the interviewers were able and willing to check the accuracy of answers, they might decide to be truthful (via the same shame that might cause them to lie in the first place). For example, in the time spent online study, respondents could be told that the researchers had access to the logs used to verify. I bet there's a meta-analysis like this somewhere and will update if I see it.
