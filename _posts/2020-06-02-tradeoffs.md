title: "A Sacred Tradeoff"
---

There's a sacred, by which I mean undiscussed, tradeoff occurring in America this week. The left has gone, in a week, from declaring social distancing the only savior left to civilization to advocating for large groups of people to gather in every major city. It's very 2013 economics-blog-reader of me to call this all signalling, but that seems most accurate.

The argument that gathering for protests is more important than social distancing has a clear starting point: dismantling structural racism is more important than continuing to flatten the curve. Although no one has made the statistical argument, it fails: a 5% reduction in social distancing with kill far more African Americans than police will kill in the next decade. But structural racism is larger than police violence. Many minorities die due to unequal access to health care, externalities pushed onto society's weakest, and lost opportunities. Some of these things are measureable, some are not. 

Protests aren't predictable; this one is surely happening at a bad time. Structural racism is a centuries-scaled issue, while covid is a 1-5 year problem. If this latest wave of protests had occurred a year in either direction, one of the most potent arguments against it would be removed (not that those opposed would have had trouble finding new ones). 

These protests are happening now in large part due to Covid. America has been cooped up, fired, had their pay cut, gotten sick, had to watch their mothers' funeral on Zoom, missed their niece's graduation, and not gotten laid since February. We're angry. And then an [incident][scholar] happens and it's time to let all that out at the hundreds of deserving targets dressed up like punching bags outside of our house; what else would be expected?

But anyone calling for policy change should have the facts on their side, not just truth and a banging fist. These protestors aren't trying to convince me: first, I already agree with them. But second, this wouldn't be the way to do it. Being on the streets today represents a willful disregard for human life that is alien. 

I sympathize with the anger, but I can't share in it. Maybe virtue ethics is the default state of human ethics. With lives on a scale, you choose the side with more lives and... justice? It must be more sophisticated than those protesting simply not acknowledging the risk to themselves rather than their parents and grandparents, and therefore seeing the tradeoff as worth it to them. If not, God help consequentialists.
