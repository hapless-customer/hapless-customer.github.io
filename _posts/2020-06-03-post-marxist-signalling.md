title: "Signalling Should Be Treated as Subconscious First"
---

[Scholar][scholar] posits a post-Marxist critique of "economics or evolutionary psychology" critiques of leftists. He compares "the central idea of signalling—that public writing and speaking is mostly about manipulating other's perceptions of yourself" to Marx himself:

>Marx, also like the evolutionary psychologists, furiously denied that ideas and impulses have their origins in a "realm of pure thought." In words that could easily be uttered by any evolutionary psychologist today, he argued that "from the start the “spirit” is afflicted with the curse of being “burdened” with matter," and that any science of human society must be built on a clear-eyed picture of the relationship between ideas, impulses, and emotions on the one hand, and their material foundations on the other.

Signalling is the astrology of the 2010s: all the cool rationalists are debunking it. Maybe we've gotten a bit trigger happy? While everything is signalling, also too many things are signalling. How is it a useful concept when confronted with the (very real) vocal anger of the left in BLM protests? 

My gut says ignorance: activists don't have the context, and are too easily swayed by videos on social media. That's both true to point where it's unnecessary to expand upon, and obviously false. I have smart, well-educated, cosmopolitan friends on the streets right now. We know that they know that 15,000 children under the age of five die preventable deaths every day because we've told them. Why tweet about BLM and not those 15,000? Why post on Instagram, why show up where your friends will see you (besides it being like crack to see friends these days)? 

Showing up in person may be more effective to end structural racism than global inequality and malaria; the same for media (social and otherwise) attention. That is, structural racism is more tractable than child mortality. Not only is this demonstrably false, it's dangerous. When an easy problem is labeled as a hard problem, it's near impossible change it back. 

Back to Scholar, he dismisses the simplest saving grace for leftist politics: the signalling is unconscious. 

>As with the Marxist theorists, signalling theorists are happy to conclude that signalling does not need to be a fully conscious process. In place of a class consciousness imposed by the material circumstances of an individual's social status, signalling theorists trace the origins of self-interested arguments to mental social-status 'modules' imposed by the material circumstances of an individual's evolutionary heritage. 

The subconscious explanation is simpler than that: young people ("get off my lawn!") want to rebel against existing power structures and get laid. All the other hot people have designated the socially acceptable rebellion place as "leftism", and so that's what you need to signal to a) fit in and b) get laid. 

Finally, signalling has to be costly. Everyone agrees fewer kids should die of malaria; less than everyone agrees we should restrict the ability of police to murder African Americans. While most young (white) leftists aren't giving up much by being leftist, they're giving up even less by saying "we should end malaria". 

I spent less time on Scholar's signalling argument than I would have liked, but I'll note that down to anger and move on.
