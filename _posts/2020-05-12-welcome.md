I built this site on GitHub Pages, using the minima Jekyll layout. I was inspired by other GitHub Pages I've seen, mostly belonging to projects or academic users. Set up took about five minutes from the "not-having-an-account" step. Beyond the simplicity, GitHub Pages has another advantage: it looks impressive. 

"Why GitHub" will be a later topic. This page describes the set up process:

## 1: Make a GitHub Account

GitHub is a site that hosts project version control using Git, widely used for software development. You can make an account [here][github-join].

## 2: Pick a Jekyll Theme

The easiest way to get started is to choose a theme from Jekyll, a static web page generator. GitHub pages supports [a few themes][jekyll-themes] that make set up easy, including the one you're looking at right now.

Each link will take you to that theme's repository on GitHub; click on the link at the top to see a sample of what that theme would look like. The minima template looks like [this][minima-sample]; the repository is [here][minima-repository].  

## 3: Fork the Repository

Once you've chosen your theme, click "Fork" on the repository and, in settings, change the repository name to "your-username.github.io". Then open the `_config.yml` file and enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options to personalize. 

## 4: Start Writing

Each repository (which you've now forked) will have a folder called `_posts`. Open this up, and start editing existing posts or create new ones. This is the step I'm on as I'm writing this, and you can see how well it's going!

This is where we start writing. Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
