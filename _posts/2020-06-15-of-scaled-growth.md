title: "Does Size Matter? - return"
---

There are plenty of essays titled "Does Size Matter?"; the world doesn't need another one. The relationship between an organization's size and it's proportional growth, however, is rife with opportunities for such humor. 

This will walk through Gibrat's law, Zipf's law, the log normal distribution, and how we can think of growth and absolute size. See particularly Kremer's people as brains and people as stomachs. 

## Gibrat's Law

Robert Gibrat, a French economist writing in the 1930s, thought he had the answer. Based on surveys of industrial and services firms, the proportional rate of growth of a firm is independent of its absolute size. He wrote in French, and I haven't tried very hard to find an English original source. 

### Critiques

Gibrat's law is broadly stated: there is no relationship between firm size and growth rate. This has spurred a lucrative sub-market of literature disproving Gibrat for differing sectors of the economy.
