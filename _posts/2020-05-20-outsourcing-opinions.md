title: Outsourcing Idea Generation
---

There are a lot of topics I need opinions about. 

## Examples

### 1: Retail

When I need to buy something new (say, underwear or headphones), my first step is usually googling "site:reddit.com best underwear". 

### 2: Moral Actions

Just as I don't take the time and money to try on eight brands of underwear, I don't research every potentially effective charity myself. There are people and organizations who do this due diligence, and publish their methodologies at a clear level, and publish straightforward "donate to x if you believe y" results. This is where I plug [GiveWell][givewell]. 

There are dangers to this: a charity could lie to the evaluator or the evaluator could make methodological mistakes (nothing replicates anyway). There are also inefficiencies. GiveWell's evaluators don't share their users' precise moral views in an unknown way, so their charity selections will differ from ours in some small ways.  

### 3: Moral Beliefs

Mood affiliation to -isms, outsourcing moralism to political parties, moral uncertainty (Macaskillian sense)

## Danger of Information Cascades

Quote about Glastonbury from Bostrom; relate to above examples
