title: Outsourcing Idea Generation
---

There are a lot of topics we need opinions about to function in everyday life. Some are a matter of preference - we get pizza rather than burgers for lunch because we like pizza better. Others are built up around observed facts. Some are a combination - from a moral base (our preferences), we form opinions based on what we see.

Forming opinions is time- and effort- consuming. Often, it's much easier to outsource these opinions, to soures or people we trust, or to "luck". 

## Examples

### 1: Retail

When I need to buy something new (say, underwear or headphones), my first step is usually googling "site:reddit.com best underwear". I look through replies, using a straightforward upvoting/downvoting system, and read the rationales provided for everyone's preference. Some of these commenters have tried on dozens of types of underwear in search of the perfect pair, and it shows. 

Many of us don't have the time, or want to spend the money, to try dozens of retail options. This is where fanatics are useful. There's someone who will try every style, flavor, make, model, and get joy out of it. Then they'll tell us which one is best! For free! This creates huge efficiency savings. 

### 2: Moral Actions

Just as I don't take the time and money to try on eight brands of underwear, I don't research every potentially effective charity myself. There are people and organizations who do this due diligence, and publish their methodologies at a clear level, and publish straightforward "donate to x if you believe y" results. This is where I plug [GiveWell][givewell]. 

There are dangers to this: a charity could lie to the evaluator or the evaluator could make methodological mistakes (nothing replicates anyway). There are also inefficiencies. GiveWell's evaluators don't share their users' precise moral views in an unknown way, so their charity selections will differ from ours in some small ways.  

### 3: Moral Beliefs

There are many political opinions to have, and it's not clear why they're correlated. In the US, why is someone's position on abortion rights a predictor of their view on climate change policy? For someone ignorant of the history (from the "outside view"), the association makes no obvious sense. This gets even more complex when we move away from hot button issues - how is a layperson supposed to choose their position on trade policy? Glass-Steagall? The minute tweaks in federal regulation that can save or damn thousands almost at a flip of a coin?

There are two senses of outsourcing here. First, we listen to our political teams. "The Democrats support <i>this</i> policy and I'm a Democrat, therefore I support this policy." This is definitely one way of saving time; forming a coherent, outside view position on trade policy is a PhD level task. 

The second sense is mood affiliation. In the fallacy of mood affiliation, people choose a mood or attitude, then find the disparate views which match to that mood and. For example, in this Covid environment, some people have chosen "caution" as their mood, and others have chosen "boldness". The models that this would implement either one of these moods would inspire behavior different from what we expect - see Tyler Cowen [here][mood-pandemic] for a more succint round up.

## Danger of Information Cascades

Outsourcing opinion generation can save time and effort for the majority, but can also lead to contradiction and working against one's interests. I'll come back to information cascades, and how individuals may want to reduce their opinion intake, soon.
