title: "Mind-Killer Stories and Development"
---

I've always appreciated approaches which harness the mind-killer: Scott Alexander's anti-conspiracy theories, for example. It's like making sure your arguments (as soldiers) are dressed in camoflougue, so that the other side can't just decide their position based on uniform.

If you can confuse the audience's mood affiliation enough, they have to evaluate the arument itself to discover their position. This is the opposite of putting [statistics over stories][stories]. Remember that "stories are more powerful than statistics. And most statistics are incomplete props to justify a story." Rather, if we tell a story that <i>doesn't make any sense</i>, then the audience has nothing to mood affiliate to, or chooses to latch on to the most obvious, but not necessarily salient, detail.  

For a while, development had a good run with "you can feed a child for a dime a day" mailings accompanied by pictures of plump Somali infants. Then that story got old. I think it's surprising effective altruists haven't tried similarly crude tactics. It's ghastly, but see what the video of George Floyd's death did for BLM's cause. There are 15,000 daily deaths we could prevent; surely a video of one of those is shocking enough to inspire action on American's part.

American's can't get enough of politics. Can we reframe development as politics?
