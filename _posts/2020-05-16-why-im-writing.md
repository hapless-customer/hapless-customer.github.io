title: Why I'm Writing

When I'm thinking of trying to get good at something, a fun question to ask has been, [“What is it you do to train that is comparable to a pianist practicing scales?”][like-scales]. For example, I run through flashcards every day: some are for thought patterns I'm trying to reinforce (front: a task that takes <3 minutes; back: do it right now) or pieces of information I want closer to hand, e.g. the directions to nursing homes we commonly respond to at the Rescue Squad. 

This isn't complex thinking or memory use, but neither are scales. It's muscle memory - when I see the name of a nursing home, my mind can recall the whole route immediately. Just practicing becomes habit forming in itself; I do those "scales" (flashchards everyday now).
