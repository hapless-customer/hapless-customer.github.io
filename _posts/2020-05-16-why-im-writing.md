title: Why I'm Writing
---

When I'm thinking of trying to get good at something, a fun question to ask has been, [“What is it you do to train that is comparable to a pianist practicing scales?”][like-scales]. For example, I run through [flashcards][anki] every day: some are for thought patterns I'm trying to reinforce (front: a task that takes <3 minutes; back: do it right now) or pieces of information I want closer to hand, e.g. the directions to nursing homes we commonly respond to at the Rescue Squad. 

This isn't complex thinking or memory use, but neither are scales. It's muscle memory - when I see the name of a nursing home, my mind can recall the whole route immediately. Just practicing becomes habit forming in itself; I do those "scales" (flashchards everyday now).

There's another useful framing of writing every day. Adam Tooze:
> Tather than thinking {writing} was something terrifying that I had to steel myself to do, the best way to think about it was as something I do every day, so it’s like exercise. If I have the chance, I like to exercise. It’s a puzzling activity. I just treat it almost as a game, rearranging the words, trying to fix things.

This is why I write. First, I want to have ideas, and second, I want those ideas to bring about change. Writing is applied thinking; perhaps more accurately, thinking is a jam session and writing is big band. Putting words on the screen, and making sure each sentence connects to the next and previous, makes idea generating a process rather than an easter egg hunt. I'd add something to Cowen's second point [here][writing-everyday]: "Much of my writing time is devoted to laying out points of view which are not my own" - <i>yet</i>.

Once I have the ideas (and this process won't start entirely from the dark - I do have some things I'd like to write about!), spareading them through writing is far more efficient than going person to person and telling them. Writing is a skill, and one that benefits from scale-like practice. Even just 10 minutes a day will move this forward. 

I'm never going to be a prolific writer - for some people, essays and posts and papers appear from their free time, as flashcards appear from mine. But carving out 10 minutes is easy and necessary. 

That's why I'm here, and maybe why I've guilted you into being here. I'm practicing a skill I'll need to do the things that need to be done. On the way, I might come across ideas worth pursuing, and those might lead to projects, or other ideas, and this will all build on itself.
