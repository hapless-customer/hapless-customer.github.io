The deaths of people far away from ourselves (in physical distance and social exposure) are less emotionally salient than the deaths of those near to us. 

The non-letal and indirect negative effects of bad policing are ill-understood and largely unquantified. In comparing the effects of bad policing to the worsening of Covid due to lax social distancing, Rob Wiblin writes:

>While police killings or murders draw the most attention, much more damage is probably done in other ways, such as through over-incarceration, petty harassment, framing innocent people, bankrupting folks through unnecessary fines, enforcing bad laws such a drug prohibition, assaults, and so on. And that total damage accumulates year after year.
