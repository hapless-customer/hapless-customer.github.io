title: "Manufacturing a Meme Resurgence"
---

When <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> was put on Netflix last week, it got that "Top 10" badge within two days. Despite having never seen the show, and with only a passing knowledge of the relevant memes, it was predictable that this show's availability on Netflix would a be a cultural event. 

Unlike other big streaming additions (for example, the anticipated drop of <i>Hamilton</i> on Disney+ next month), Avatar was a surprise. This strategy is a function of coronavirus: when else would everyone be bored enough to immediately start a show for nostalgia. 

What other shows would have created such a splash? We're going to see fewer surpise drops like this in the future, as television production is divided between companies, each with their own streaming service. 

This also shows just how much of the success Netflix (and kin) is due to their UI's. It's absurdly easy to find a show like Avatar online unofficially, with neglible virus risk, and non-invasive ads. There are two things we're paying for with Netflix: the weird movies that are hard to find online, and convenience.
