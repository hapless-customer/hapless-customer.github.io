title: "Memorizing Lists"
---

I've recently tried to commit ordered lists to memory a few ways. All of these techniques have used spaced repetition (is there another phrase for "doing something over and over to learn it"?), specifically Anki. Let's describe these techniques using street directions. Each step has an action ("RIGHT") and a location ("on Brookville Rd"). 

## 1: Fill in the Next Step

Picture a flash card, the front of which provides the first few directions stopping where the user is to provide the next step.

```html
LEFT on Grubb
BEAR RIGHT on Lyttonsville Rd
LEFT on Lyttonsville P
...
```

The back of the card provides the missing step ```RIGHT on Brookville Rd```. This is the msot straightforward strategy, because it's how reality works. When driving from one place to another, you do each step one at a time. The driver would be looking for the turn on to Brookville after making the turn on to Lyttonsville, which primes their mind for the Brookville step.

This could be modified by just including the two to three steps immediately prior to the requested step. I've done this typically for longer lists - say with dozens of items, like presidents or books of the bible. These are the steps required for immediate prompting, and I don't think anything has been lost in that. 

## 2: Fill in the Blank

In this technique, the full list, except for the item to be returned, is presented: 

```html
LEFT on Grubb
BEAR RIGHT on Lyttonsville Rd
LEFT on Lyttonsville Pl
...
LEFT on Georgia Ave
RIGHT on Forest Glen
```

And the back of the card has the requested answer ```RIGHT on Brookville Rd```. In this technique, additional information can be actively harmful (see my earlier post about the perils of extra information in horse handicapping - synthesis coming). If a driver was on Lyttonsville Pl. and knew they eventually needed to get to Georgia Ave, this system would not help them remember Brookville. 

Additional information and context is not always useful in forming memories of lists.
