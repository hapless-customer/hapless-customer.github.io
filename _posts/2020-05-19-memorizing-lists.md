title: "Memorizing Lists"
---

I've recently tried to commit ordered lists to memory a few ways. All of these techniques have used spaced repetition (is there another phrase for "doing something over and over to learn it"?), specifically Anki. Let's describe these techniques using street directions. Each step has an action ("RIGHT") and a location ("on Brookville Rd"). 

## 1: Fill In the Blank

In this technique, the full list, except for the item to be returned, is presented: 

```html
LEFT on Grubb
BEAR RIGHT on Lyttonsville Rd
LEFT on Lyttonsville Pl
...
LEFT on Georgia Ave
RIGHT on Forest Glen
```

And the back of the card has the requested answer ```html RIGHT on Brookville Rd```.
