title: "Should I Be Negative Discounting?"
---

Apparently, [no one][no] thinks that we should discount future welfare anymore. It's good we have that issue resolved.

Today, I was looking to buy a Kindle on Amazon. There are two options: the base Kindle ($65 USD), and the Kindle Paperwhite ($100 USD). Both are heavily discounted (for Juneteenth? It's only a matter of time from Juneteenth becoming a widely recognized holiday until we see Memorial Day-style mattress and Toyota commercials), but these were the prices I was facing. 

The Paperwhite is a solidly mid-range option, compared to the Kindle. It's screen has twice as many pixes (wow!), it's waterproof (only to two meters, however), and has 32 GB of memory (for those 80,000 page MOBI files). But to spendthrift me (I think this is the first reference to the title of this blog), none of that seemed worth $35 USD. 

To make sure I agreed with myself, which is rare enough to be worth checking, I considered: I'll likely use this reader for four to fifteen years (barring destruction, loss, or invention of injectable books). If I use it for ten years then, would the better screen etc. be worth $3.5 USD per year? Surprisingly, the answer was no.

I prefer $35 USD (plus interest, I suppose) in ten years, to a substantially better product today (well, Tuesday: only two day shipping, here). There are several fine reasons for discounting financial returns, and one neutral one (present time preference). But there's one unpopular, and morally supererogative, reason: we should be expending our resources on the future because it's bigger. It's mind-bogglingly big. And because of its size, it is imperative that the future occurs, and isn't full of suffering. 

So, even though it's probably because I'm a cheap bastard, I'm going to say this is why I want to negatively discount my welfare. Tomorrow is a lot more important than yesterday, morally speaking, and both are more important than today. My having a slightly worse Kindle won't change any of that though. But it will buy five Chipotle burritos.
