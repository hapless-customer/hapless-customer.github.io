title: "Grainstack of False Equivalencies"
---

Here's an argument someone could make to me: [15,000 children][kids] under the age of five die every day, mostly in the least advantaged parts of the world. [1,000 people][police] of all races were killed by police in all of 2019. It is far more tractable to keep the children alive, as they are dying of things like malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia which we have cheap solutions to, unlike police violence which is [much murkier][works] to solve. Furthermore, every dollar and hour we spend on one of these problems, we can't spend on another. Therefore, we should be spending more time, effort, and money on one of these problems than the other.

I reject this for a few highly personal reasons related to my meta-ethics, which I'm sure are not shared by many. The first, and least endorsed, is proximity: Singer's drowning child is the classic formulation. Because I'm closer to the people being hurt and killed in the US than the children dying abroad, I owe them more.

Second, I directly benefit from the power structure which oppresses African Americans and leads to some being killed by police. The laws that empower law enforcement protect me in a way that they do not for African Americans. The history of the US goes in my favor is so many ways, and in no ways for them. Do I also benefit from any direct privilige relative to children dying of diseases in Africa and Asia? Yes, but in different ways. I was lucky to be born in the US (to be intersectional, so are African Americans); these dying children were not. The US has abused and abuses other countries, forcing externalities such as climate change upon them, and failing to provide a stable global environment. I benefit from this, particularly relative to those in developing countries. Furthermore, I was lucky to be born earlier, children are certainly [less advocated for and protected][final] than adult victims. 

However, these privileges are not as relevant as the domestic oppression structure. I have walked streets that African Americans couldn't walk without putting their lives at risk, and gotten into schools that African Americans have been barred from, and said things aloud that would have gotten African Americans killed just decades ago. With this level of proximity, and my direct benefit, I owe so much more to the thousand dying each year here than the thousands dying each day overseas. 

This is not Manichean. Dismantling racism will keep more children under five alive in the US, by improving community health and improving equal access to resources. And eliminating malaria in Africa will hopefully improve life for African Americans in the US as well. We should not have to pick only one cause to work on. Further, the 1,000 people of any race killed by police is not the right comparison, but rather all of those lives lost in any immeasureable way to structural racism. While not 15,000 per day, the toll is certainly much higher. 

One thing I'd like an expert's opinion on is how the multi-disciplinary nature of being African American affects this calculus. Being born American is clearly a privilege in this world, giving years extra of life expectancy, orders of magnitude extra of accumulated life and comfort, relative to the least advantaged countries. How does this play agaisnt a relative disprivilege in a different frame of reference, being African American in America? Frames of reference seem to mess up my calculus along these lines. 

Finally, a relatively unexplored thought: those killed by police are killed by a person; those children dying of disease are being killed by unconscious bacteria and viruses. Intuition indicates that we owe more to the former than latter, but we know that humans are [wired that way][foes].
