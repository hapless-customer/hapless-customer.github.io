We don't take each other seriously enough, when they talk about their own experiences. This is language's fault: in speaking and writing, all languages employ metaphors and similes instead of saying what they mean.

Some people can go as far as thinking the concept of "smell" is a metaphor, or even as far as living decades without the concept of "thinking".
