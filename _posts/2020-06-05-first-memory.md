We don't take other people seriously enough when they talk about their own experiences. This is language's fault: in speaking and writing, all languages employ metaphors and similes instead of saying what they mean.

Some people can go as far as thinking the [concept of "smell"][smell] is a metaphor, or even as far as living decades without the [concept of "thinking"][conscious]. Of course, reading these, it didn't seem possible that I would be missing any such experiences. Ted Chiang's excellent short story "The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling" in his new collection <i>Exhalation</i> disabused me.
