title: "Taking Metaphors Seriously, Especially Around Memory"
---

We don't take other people seriously enough when they talk about their own experiences. This is language's fault: in speaking and writing, all languages employ metaphors and similes instead of saying what they mean.

Some people can go as far as thinking the [concept of "smell"][smell] is a metaphor, or even as far as living decades without the [concept of "thinking"][conscious]. Of course, reading these, it didn't seem possible that I would be missing any such experiences. Ted Chiang's excellent short story "The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling" in his new collection <i>Exhalation</i> disabused me. 

>Another of my earliest memories is of playing on the living room rug, pushing toy cars around, while my grandmother worked at her sewing machine; she would occasionally turn and smile warmly at me. There are no photos of that moment, so I know the recollection is mine and mine alone.

It's a common trope, but "Truth" takes it further: plenty of characters discuss their earliest memories, as memory is what makes us. To me, it was just a literary trope. No one really remembers anything from before they were a teenager, and certainly not without recordings of those events. It had never really occurred to me that personal memories can persist from that age.

Realizing the idiocy of this, it's interesting to interrogate the intuition. Did I/do I think that my memories of today will disappear when I'm as far from today as today is from elementary school? Do I need an external memory system, as Faceless Technology Corporation is offering in Chiang's story? And what can replicate that for me, until we have sufficient video for personal instant replay?

As interesting as this is, I find it more worrying that I may be missing something else fundamental. Ignore all metaphors, take everything serious.
