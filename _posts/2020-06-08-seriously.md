title: "Taking Everything Seriously"
---

If we asked protestors if they'd rather a) reduce the number of people killed by police by one, or b) reduce the number of children dying of malaria by 100, they would presumably choose b. Many protestors understand choices and opportunity cost, and are on the streets nonetheless. Therefore, this isn't what they're choosing between. Or rather, it's not a 
 
I have been very uncharitable to the protestors so far: the only way they could justify their actions, from my point of view, was ignorance. As they were unaware that black lives could be saved much more effectively in Africa, their actions were foregiveable as the clearest, most straightforward way to address society's disregard for Black lives. 

This was clearly wrong, and in an obvious way. A [CSIS interview series][csis] and a fantastic Alan Taylor series bashed me over the head with this. 

CSIS's "Africa Reacts" series asks prominent African intellectuals for their views and opinions about American politics, to reverse the narrative of American policy and development impacting the rest of the world and never vice versa. The first three installments were focused on the 2020 Democratic primary and runup to the general election, but in the wake of the protests sweeping the world, CSIS "asked top African thinkers to provide their reactions to Floyd’s death, the protests engulfing the United States, and the U.S. government response." 

The responses are what I would expect from having been on twitter for the past weeks. Africans expressing despair for African Americans, terrified of how the Superpower could have come to this, lamentations of how "this is our shame ... as a continent, we have failed our African American brothers and sisters." When a Kenyan journalist says, "we owe our Black brothers and sisters an apology for centuries of neglect", how am I supposed to react?

As neither the one being apologized for, nor the one being apologized to, it is not my place to critique. However, I am blown away. Africans have had no systemic ability to cherish or neglect the status of African Americans going back centuries. Rhetoric is one way Africans could have supported their American brothers and sisters, but the African Union is 21 years old, not centuries. Policy? I don't have to look up the historical trade deficit between the US and African to dismiss boycotts or tarriffs. Similarly, it was not African countries' immigration policies that kept African Americans from migrating to the African experiment (Liberia as an interesting example). 

If any burden of duty exists, it is African Americans who have neglected the African continent. Expand and critique. 

I admit my intuitions are inconsistent here. There's a reading of the above that is: "you don't get to critique our house; your house is bad enough; I'll be over to help you in a moment." No one involved with development will argue that Africa is better off than America; similarly, no one will argue America is perfect. The aspect of this I endorse is that when prioritizing, fixing Africa's house is at the top of my list. It is best to do this in non-social, universally positive ways, such as bed-nets and deworming. 

There are many sentiments in the "Africa Reacts" interviews which I sympathize with, not least the weakening of America's reputation as a figurehead of democracy on the world stage and hints of cosmopolitanism within Pan-Africanism. I'll quote the two most important comments from the end of piece, first from Ayisha Osori:

>There is a renewed sense that the tribulations of people of African descent—particularly in the United States—are connected to the struggle to secure the dignity of Africans. It appears that only when the African dream of inclusion, justice, solidarity, and prosperity is realized in Africa will people of African descent walk this earth in the fullness of their stature.

>In the mid-twentieth century, classical Pan-Africanism conceived of this struggle for Black dignity as both the quest for independence by anti-colonial agitators and the civil rights movement in the United States. Both campaigns were mutually reinforcing streams in a global quest for racial justice. Today, those two streams no longer reinforce each other, one having run dry while the other continues to boil. Now more than ever, Africa must get its act together, inspired by the unrelenting spirit of African Americans, to deepen democracy and build a more just, fair, and enabling continent.

And Miles Tendi:

>The current U.S. crisis underlines the stark double standards that exist when it comes to protection of human rights. When a grave human-rights-violating state such as Zimbabwe is able to make great play of the human rights violations committed by America, which is supposed to uphold human rights principles more highly than other states, then you have a major problem for the human rights agenda. This hampers the United States’ ability to intervene in countries that violate human rights such as Zimbabwe.

>When pressed to condemn Donald Trump’s response to the killing of George Floyd, the UK foreign minister had this to say: It would be a “media distraction . . . I’m not going to start commenting on the commentary or indeed the press statements that other world leaders make, or indeed the U.S. president.” He would not condemn the U.S. on human rights grounds. But this same UK government had condemned the Zimbabwean government for the recent events. The West’s moral authority on human rights is undercut by George Floyd’s death and the police brutality we’ve seen in response to protests. Moral authority is at one of its all-time lows for the U.S. and the UK.

"Moral authority" is a powerful, and important concept in international development, especially by government offices. I'll hopefully write more about this in the future. 

I'll close with Alan Taylor's photo series, found [here][photo]. It includes several gorgeous photos taken in countries' which are struglling in exactly the ways that should pull our attention more than the plight of African Americans.
